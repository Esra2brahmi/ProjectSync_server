🔮 Perspective
ProjectSync is a continuously evolving platform. While the current version provides solid project management tools tailored for academic needs, we envision expanding its capabilities to deliver an even smoother experience for students, supervisors, and jury members.

Planned enhancements include:

💬 Real-time messaging between students and supervisors

📊 Student performance analytics and evaluation dashboards

🔔 Smart notifications for deadlines and task updates

📅 Calendar view for scheduling and milestones

🧠 AI-assisted feedback suggestions for submitted reports (ambitious but possible!)

🌐 Multi-language support for broader accessibility
